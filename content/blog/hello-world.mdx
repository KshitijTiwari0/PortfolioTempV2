# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 introduces powerful new features that make building modern web applications faster and more efficient than ever before.

## What's New?

The App Router has revolutionized how we structure Next.js applications. With server components, streaming, and improved data fetching, you can build incredibly fast and scalable applications.

## Key Features

- **Server Components**: By default, all components are server components, reducing client-side JavaScript
- **App Router**: A more intuitive routing system based on the file system
- **Streaming**: Deliver parts of your page before the rest is ready
- **Data Fetching**: Simplified data fetching with built-in caching and revalidation

## Getting Started

To start building with Next.js 15:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your application running.

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js combines the flexibility of React with powerful backend capabilities, making it ideal for building full-stack applications. Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex e-commerce platform, Next.js has you covered.

The combination of TypeScript support, built-in optimization, and an excellent developer experience makes Next.js the framework of choice for modern web development.
